    "\n",
    "Testing multiple hypothesis from the same data can be problematic. Exhaustively testing all pairwise relationships between variables in a data set is a commonly used, but generally misleading from of multiple comparisons. The chance of finding false significance, using such a **data dredging** approach, can be surprisingly high. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will perform multiple comparisons on 20 **identically distributed independent (iid)** variables. Ideally, such tests should not find significant relationships, but the actual result is quite different. \n",
