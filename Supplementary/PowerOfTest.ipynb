    "# Power of Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have already seen, there is a significant risk of finding falsely significant results when testing hypotheses. On the other hand, there is also a significant chance that an actual effect will not be detected. We call the ability of a test to detect an actual effect as the **power**.   \n",
    "\n",
    ">The **power of a test** is formally defined as:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$power = P(reject\\ H_0| when\\ H_a\\ is\\ true)$$   \n",
    "\n",
    ">In pain language, the power is the probability of getting a positive result when the null hypothesis is not true. Conversely, a test with insufficient power will not detect a real effect. Clearly, we want the most powerful test we can find for the situation. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Computing test power can be a bit complex, and analytical solutions can be difficult or impossible. Often, a simulation is used to compute power. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will compute the power for a two sample t-test. The power of this test depends on the several parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of samples.\n",
    "- The anticipated difference in the population means, which we call the **effect size**.\n",
    "- The significance level chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running a power test, you can ask several questions, which will assist you in designing an experiment. Usually, you will determine how big a sample you need to detect an effect of the expected size. You can also determine how big an effect needs to be given a fixed sample size (all the samples you have or can afford) to detect an effect of the expected size. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python [statsmodels package](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.power.tt_ind_solve_power.html) provides power calculations for a limited set of hypothesis tests. We can use these capabilities to examine the characteristics of test power.\n",
